# MongoDB Record Dataset

The MongoDB Record Dataset is a write-only
[dataset](/doc/builtin/datasets/Datasets.md) that writes to a MongoDB
collection.

Rows are stored in collections to the following format:

```
{
    "_id" : <autogenerated>,
    "rowName" : <rowName>,
    "columns" : [
        {
            "columnName" : <columnName>,
            "ts" : <timestamp>,
            "data" : <cell value as a JSON string>
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

Contrarily to built in MLDB datasets, recording multiple rows with the same
name will result in multiple different records into MongoDB. Because of that,
procedures and plugins calling record row multiple times with the same row name
will produce unexpected results when they output to a MongoDB Record Dataset.
