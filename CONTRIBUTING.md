## Contributing to MLDB

Bug reports and requests for help with installing, running or using the MLDB 
Community Edition are very welcome, and the preferred mechanism for this is to 
[create a Github Issue](https://github.com/mldbai/mldb/issues/new) and a member
of the MLDB team will do their best to respond within a couple of business days.

MLDB is being actively developed by [Datacratic](http://datacratic.com/) and does 
not have a public roadmap at the moment. If you would like to contribute code or 
new features to MLDB, the best first step would be to send an email to 
mldb@datacratic.com to discuss how this might fit into existing development plans.
