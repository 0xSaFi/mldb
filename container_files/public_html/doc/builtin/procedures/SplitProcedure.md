# Dataset Split Procedure

This procedure splits a dataset into several while respecting the distribution 
of the presence of one or several labels.

This can be used, for example, to split a dataset with multiple labels
between training, testing and validation sets. This contrasts with what 
is done in the classifier.experiment(link) procedure where a random split 
is done in the data. A random split can lead to a highly unbalanced training 
and testing sets when looking at each label individually. 
It might however be necessary to calibrate the predictions using a 
[probabilizer](Probabilizer.md) procedure when training using splits generated by this procedure.

## Algorithm

The procedure uses a greedy algorithm and is not guaranteed to return the optimal solution.
The algorithm will try to assure than every label is represented in all splits.
If a label is represented in fewer rows than there are splits, the rows will be placed in the 
firsts splits.
