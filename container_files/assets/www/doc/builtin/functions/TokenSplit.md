Token Split Function

The token split function is a utility function that will insert a separating character before and after specified tokens in a string.
This can be useful when preparing bags of words data for training. The function will add the specified split character only if there
is not one already.

## Configuration
![](%%config function tokensplit)

## Input and Output Values

The function takes a single input named `text` that contains the string to parse and returns a single input named `output` that contains
the input string with the split characters inserted.
